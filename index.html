								Our vegan burger will leave you stunned by the flavor. Our
								homemade burger patties are not like any other bland patty, ours
								come packed with <strong>protein</strong>, plenty of herbs and
								spices. Dressing up it with our homemade cheddar cheese and
								topped with your choice of lettuce or kale, onions and tomato.
								With our french fries included, your going to be shocked at how
								good a plant based burger can really be.

								Yes, that is right, we have steak and of course its plant-based.
								Our homemade steak is based off of <strong>gluten</strong>.
								Seasoned to perfection, you'll love those hints of oregano and
								salt buzzing those taste buds. Served with your choice of two
								sides and a drink, you will be wondering
								<i>why haven't I changed to plant-based diet, yet?</i>

								A plant-based spin on a lovely classic, that we all enjoy. Our
								fried chik'n is more that just finger licking good, it just
								defies everything that you might know about food, especially
								plant-based food. Fried to a cripsy perfection with those lovely
								fries, you will be wondering
								<i> how good will this taste on a sandwich? </i>

							We here at Tierra, are very concerned with our planet
							<strong>mother earth</strong>. One of the biggest threats to
							mother earth is <strong> climate change</strong> and one of the
							factors affecting that climate change, is
							<strong>factory farming</strong>. We must change our eating habits
							so we can ease the damage caused by intensive animal farming. We
							have dedicated our lives to help our society transition from
							consuming animal products to plant-based products.

							We know when people think of eating plant-based or vegan, two
							things usually come to mind, <i>boring and taste like dirt</i>.
							But we here at Tierra, made sure that none of our food is boring.
							We went above and beyond to make sure when we serve our food on
							the table, that all the rich and lovely flavor is there and not in
							the <i>dirt</i>. When our customers leave here, they will leave
							here not just satisfied; but even more knowledgeable than before.
							They know now, that the animal products that they use to love
							wasn't all that tasteful. What was tasteful was the way the food
							was prepared. Now, a plant-based lifestyle seems doable and even
							maintainable; for any individual that comes through these doors.
